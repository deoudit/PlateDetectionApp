# PlateDetectionApp
This will allow us to detect the Licence Number Plate of various vehicles especially Cars.


# The approach used to segment the images is Connected Component Analysis.

# Grayscale Image -> Binary Image -> Applying CCA to get connected regions -> Detect license plate out of all connected regions

# Model is trained using SVC
